Practical Exercise - Jscrambler
===============================

A Command Line Interface (CLI) is to be implemented in Node.js that
receives a URL as an input to a remote HTML resource and returns a JSON as output
with relevant meta information about the markup obtained.

Examples of relevant meta information:

* Number of HTML tags (per name);
* Number of attributes per HTML tag;
* Downloaded resource types (image, video, etc) and hosts where they were
  discharged from;
* Number of children and which, per type of HTML tag;	
* The depth of the tree;

All additional meta information will be considered and valued.

## Requirements

- Develop the solution in ES6;
- Production of unit tests;
- Production of documentation.

The expected result goes beyond functionality, being evaluated critical aspects such as:

* code performance / scalability
* safety aspects
* code quality

## Delivery

The delivery must be done by sending a `tar.gz` file containing the
repository as well as any other element produced and relevant to the
evaluation of the delivered solution.
